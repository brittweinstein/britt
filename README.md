Here you can find tools I've created to help with the tedious CM related tasks. 

You can find the PDF Print status tool, Migration Helper (for automated, timed migration use only--not for regular content migration), and ID Conversion tools for all servers. Documentation exists for all of these. Simply download the documentation and script to execute!
