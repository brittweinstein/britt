We now have the availability to work the conversion tool on other servers besides Production: QA, Staging, and in some cases, TEA. 

Each server will require a different script. **The server name is indicated in the title.** For example, prodconversion-tool.py, teaconversion-tool.py, qaconversion-tool.py, and stagingconversion-tool.py. 

Download the appropriate script from this repo. 

Open a new window in terminal. 

Access the folder where your script is now stored. IE: cd Downloads 

Tell terminal to run the script. IE: python ./stagingconversion-tool.py 

You will be prompted questions about the conversion. 

The fist questions is "Do you want to input module IDs or collection IDs?" 
--Type "m" for modules or "c" for collection 

Input ID 
--Type the module or collection ID

Do you want all of the module IDs in this collection?
--Type "y" for yes or "n" for no

Pick the output format: csv, excel, or terminal.
--Type "c" for csv, "e" for excel, or "t" for "tsv"

Type the filename you want for the exported file.
--Type the desired file name. IE: ChemistryConversion


Your file will be created! You can find the output in the same folder where your script is stored.
