This tool is useful if you are trying to migrate multiple sets of content at one time. For example, 
it using LaunchControl (or a similar program) you could automatically launch different 
migration tasks. 

Each tell and end tell corresponds to one migration set. Simply change the file names and paths to 
what exists on your machine and run this script in AppleScript Editor.

  however your commands will likely be different!
