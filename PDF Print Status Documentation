The PDF Print Status tool (pdf-print-status-new.py) is a tool that reads the printinfo page of collections on legacy, stores the locked status (whether or not it is true), and sends an email to those on the list.

To operate this tool automatically, it must run from a local machine through a program like LaunchControl. 

To edit the email list, add or delete an email in the list in rows 12 and 13 of the script. 

To edit the collections, add or delete a row from booklist starting at row 45. REMEMBER TO FORMAT THE SYNTAX IDENTICALLY TO THOSE AROUND IT.
